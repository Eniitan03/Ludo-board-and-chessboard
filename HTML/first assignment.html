      >This is a story of a stunning girl Shanti aged 16 years, lived in a
      backward area. She was very good in studies and also holds a ranking
      position at a government school and was very active in other co-curriculum
      activities too. She was a girl who was somehow very different from others.
      As she was of a village, people around her and her parents were of
      backward thinking. Her reverie was to change the thinking of her villagers
      and many customs which were practiced there. For this, she used to trek
      out of her burg to take a look at that world.
